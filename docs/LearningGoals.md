# Learning Goals
The learning goal I personally set for myself for this project was to get familiar with the following technologies. I will cover the motivation to learn about the technology, any issues I faced while working with it as well as what I could do in addition to learn more about it in the future.

## OpenLayers
Despite having worked with projects utilizing OpenLayers for one and a half years, I never got much experience working on the map itself. The most complex issue I had worked on was just updating the API from which the application got its tiles from.  
My previous experience using OpenLayers's documentation was that it is relatively confusing and that you had to know a fair bit before they would prove to be useful in any meaningful capacity. I would still say that I hold this position as trying to figure out how to do anything without the proper vocabulary proved to be fairly difficult. This improved as time went on and I had spent more time working things out. There were some pitfalls that I couldn't quite figure out from various tutorials, but towards the end I felt more comfortable using a mixture of tutorials and documentation to implement the functionality I wanted to implement.  
Currently I would still want to revisit the implementations of interacting with the map. I think I could implement the Draw interaction as a custom click interaction on the map instead. I would want to implement the draw interaction to avoid creating Points on top of other points and I imagine there could be some logic like the Select interaction's hitTolerance that could be used to look for collisions.

## VectorTileLayer
The previous OpenLayers maps I've worked with have used raster tiles for their background maps. I always found these to be visually clunky especially compared to Google maps, so I've wanted to experiment with vector tiles to see how their performance in local development compares to raster tiles. I would say that I overall prefer how zooming in and out looks on vector tiles even though the used map doesn't have a whole lot of detail in it compared to most raster tiles I've used.  
There surprisingly weren't many issues getting the VectorTileLayer to work, I would say the only major issue was the select interaction being able to select features from that layer aswell before I learned you could specify the layers for a Select object. 
I would certainly want to experiment more with the VectorTileLayer as all of the configurations are currently from a tutorial. The .topojson files received from the API include various other objects that could be added to the map view. Adding places or PoIs could be a good exercise to figure out how the rules object used in the layer definition works.
